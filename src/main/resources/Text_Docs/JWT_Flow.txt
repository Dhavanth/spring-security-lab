1. Add the JWT dependencies:
implementation("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api:0.12.6")
runtimeOnly("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-impl:0.12.6")
runtimeOnly("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-jackson:0.12.6")

2. Change the session creation policy to STATELESS as JWT is stateless and does not require server-side session management.
   - This will ensure that the application does not create a session for each request, as JWTs are self-contained tokens that carry the necessary information.

3. Remove Security context explicit save as it is unnecessary for stateless applications.
   - The security context will not be saved in the session, as JWTs are used for authentication and authorization.

4. CORS Policy updates:
   - To expose JWT Tokens in the response headers to the client apps in different origins

5. JWT Token Generation:
   - Create filter that generates JWT tokens upon successful login.
   - Should generate only for login successful authentication requests but not for every request. -> shouldNotFilter() method

6. JWT Token Validation:
   - Create filter that validates JWT tokens for protected resources.
   - Should validate the token for every request other than login request -> shouldFilter() method

7. Add the JWT token generation and validation filters to the filter chain in the Spring Security configuration.
   - Ensure that the JWT token generation filter runs after the BasicAuthenticationFilter. -> because only authenticated users should receive a JWT token.
   - Ensure that the JWT token validation filter runs before the BasicAuthenticationFilter. -> because it needs to validate the token before any authentication is done.

8. Build the logic to generate JWT token inside the JWT token generation filter.
   8.1 Use the JJWT library to create a JWT token with the necessary claims (e.g., username, roles, expiration time).
   8.2 Sign the token with a secret key.
   8.3 Steps:
    - Extract the authentication object from the SecurityContext.
    - Create a secret key for signing the JWT token.
    - Set issuer -> To identify the application that generated the token (Client can be aware of the issuer).
    - Set subject -> Name of the token i.e. JWT Token.
    - Set claims -> Add the username and roles to the token.
    - Set issued at -> Current time.
    - Set expiration time -> Token should expire after a certain period
    - sign the token with the secret key.
   8.4 Set the token in the response header with a custom header name (JWT-Authorization).

9. Build the logic to validate JWT token inside the JWT token validation filter.
    9.1 Use the JJWT library to parse and validate the JWT token.
    9.2 Steps:
     - Extract the JWT token from the request header.
     - Validate the token signature using the secret key.
     - Check if the token is expired.
     - If valid, create the authentication object and set it in the SecurityContext.
     - If invalid, throw an exception or return an error response.

10. Refresh Token Logic:
Purpose: To allow users to obtain a new JWT token without re-authenticating, extending the session without requiring the user to log in again.
    - When a user logs in, they receive a JWT token as Authorization header and a refresh token as a cookie which is HttpOnly and Secure.
    - It is stored in the browser's cookies and is used to obtain a new JWT token when the current one expires.
    - It is validated and, if valid, a new JWT token & refresh token are generated and returned in the response header and cookie resp.
    - When JWT and refresh token are generated in previous step, the old refresh token is invalidated/deleted to prevent reuse.
    - It will be deleted when the user logs out or when the refresh token expires.
